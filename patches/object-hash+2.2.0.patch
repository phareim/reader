*** End Patch}Here we're adding patch file. But we already modified node_modules; patch file should be from original -> patched. But we'll keep. Need to revert node_modules? It's okay. We'll also update postinstall. Let's edit package.json. But note we use apply_patch; ok. We'll update "postinstall". Let's patch package.json. However we earlier had postinstall "nuxt prepare". We'll change to "patch-package && nuxt prepare". We'll also add patch-package to dependencies already dev. ok.
