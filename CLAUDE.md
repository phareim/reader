# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**The Reader** — a calm, self-hosted RSS reader built with Nuxt 3, Vue 3, and Cloudflare (Workers + D1 + R2). The entrance is a swipeable **card deck** of unread articles (one card, five verbs); supporting rooms are the **shelf** (saved articles) and **sources** (feed management). The whole surface is styled in the **Tufte Viz design system** (warm paper, ET Book serif, hairline rules, one crimson accent per screen). Deployed at `reader.phareim.no`.

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (runs on http://localhost:3000 or 3001 if 3000 is taken)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview

# MCP server for Claude Desktop
npm run mcp

# Tests (Jest + ts-jest + @vue/vue3-jest, jsdom)

# Run a single test file / pattern
npx jest __tests__/utils/deck.test.ts
npx jest -t "name of test"
```

Tests live in `__tests__/` mirroring the source tree. Current suites:
- `__tests__/utils/deck.test.ts` — pure deck state machine (`resolveDirection`, `advance`, `undo`)
- `__tests__/utils/grid.test.ts` — grid-view pure logic (`resolveGridDirection` distance/flick/wrong-sign-flick/diagonal-dominance, `nextPageOffset` read/saved/extraOffset accounting, `dedupeAppend` reference-preserving merge)
- `__tests__/utils/cardData.test.ts` — card derivations (`stripHtml`, `readingTimeMinutes`, `cardImageUrl`, `excerpt`)
- `__tests__/server/feedImage.test.ts` — lead-image extraction from raw feed entries (fast-xml-parser `@_` attribute shape, arrays, media:group, enclosures, content fallback)
- `__tests__/components/CardStack.test.ts` — commit/undo wiring, race guards, elevate failure paths
- `__tests__/components/DeckScreen.test.ts` — DeckScreen tag prop, 404→notFound emit, snapshot pattern, deck/grid toggle, grid keyboard branching, re-snapshot on grid→deck return
- `__tests__/components/MiniCard.test.ts` — grid mini card: image vs typographic variant, Unsplash-filler filtering, footer (feed · age), no excerpt
- `__tests__/components/ArticleGrid.test.ts` — grid commit wiring (save/read + undo toast), busy guard, LIFO undo, tap→reader, IntersectionObserver sentinel → `loadMore`, empty state
- `__tests__/components/TagEditorOverlay.test.ts` — chips, suggestion filtering, keyboard (Enter/comma/arrows/Backspace/Esc), save/close emits
- `__tests__/components/HighlightNoteOverlay.test.ts` — quote display, save emits trimmed note, Cmd/Ctrl+Enter commit, saving-guard
- `__tests__/utils/hashtags.test.ts` — `extractHashtags` (dedupe, unicode, punctuation/url boundaries), `renderNoteHtml` (escape + accent-span wrap)
- `__tests__/utils/highlightDom.test.ts` — `paintHighlight` (exact + indexOf fallback, cross-element spans), `unpaint`/`clearHighlights` round-trips
- `__tests__/utils/truncation.test.ts` — `looksTruncated` (Ars "Read full article" footer, "Continue reading", `[…]` brackets, canonical-URL anchor; negatives for full bodies + inline read-more links)
- `__tests__/utils/share.test.ts` — `xShareUrl` / `threadsShareUrl` / `xQuoteShareUrl` / `threadsQuoteShareUrl` (param shape, encoding, empty/null title, Threads link-only text, curly-quoted passage + link for quote shares)
- `__tests__/utils/readingPosition.test.ts` — `shouldRestorePosition` (3%–95% band), `restoreScrollTop` (fraction → clamped scrollTop), `progressWorthSaving` (1% write threshold)
- `__tests__/components/BottomBar.test.ts` — the four rooms render in order, Found active only on the found route, hidden on reader/login
- `__tests__/components/FoundPage.test.ts` — Found-feed resolution (empty state + refetch vs. deck scoped to the `kind='found'` feed)
- `__tests__/components/BasicComponent.test.ts` — smoke test for the Vue/Jest toolchain

`~/` and `@/` resolve to repo root (see `jest.config.js` `moduleNameMapper`). **`motion-v` is ESM and is mocked entirely** rather than transformed: `moduleNameMapper` points `motion-v` at `__tests__/mocks/motion-v.ts`, which renders `motion.*` as passthrough divs (cached per tag for stable component identity) and exposes `__setManualAnimations` / `__resolveAnimations` so tests can assert behavior mid-flight. Mock network calls rather than hitting live feeds; Nuxt auto-imported composables don't exist under Jest, so component tests provide them as `globalThis` stubs.

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Nuxt 3 (Vue 3) with auto-imported components and composables
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS themed by the **Tufte Viz design system** (see "Tufte Viz Design System & Card Deck" below), `@tailwindcss/typography` for reader prose
- **Animation**: `motion-v` (Motion for Vue) — drag physics, springs, and flings on the card deck
- **Backend**: Nitro server routes (REST-style API)
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (binding `DB`)
- **Storage**: Cloudflare R2 for article content (binding `ARTICLE_BUCKET`)
- **Auth**: Email/password with PBKDF2 hashing + cookie sessions (zero deps)
- **Feed Parsing**: `@extractus/feed-extractor` for RSS/Atom feeds (NOT rss-parser — that name is historical)
- **Content Sanitization**: isomorphic-dompurify via `utils/processArticleContent.ts`
- **Knowledge pipeline**: swipe-up "elevate" sends an article into the SFL idea tracker (see "Elevate to SFL" below)

### State Management Pattern

This app uses Nuxt's `useState` for global state management instead of Pinia/Vuex. Current composables:

- **`useArticles()`**: Article list, `unreadArticles` computed, `fetchArticles`, `markAsRead`, `markAllAsRead`; plus grid pagination — `total` / `hasMore` / `loadingMore` state and `loadMoreArticles()` (appends the next page of the last list query with the still-matching-count offset from `utils/grid.ts`; the saved-articles path resets `lastQuery`/`hasMore` so the shelf is never paginated)
- **`useViewMode()`**: The deck ↔ grid preference for the reading entrance — `viewMode` (`'deck' | 'grid'`, one global choice for all deck contexts) + `setViewMode`. Persisted in `localStorage['reader:viewMode']`; SSR always sees `'deck'`, so mode-dependent UI must render inside `<ClientOnly>` (DeckScreen does)
- **`useFeeds()`**: Feed list, `feedsByTag` grouping (untagged feeds group under `'__inbox__'`), add/delete/sync/tag operations
- **`useSavedArticles()`**: Saved article IDs (a `Set` in `useState`), `saveArticle` / `unsaveArticle` / `isSaved`
- **`useTags()`**: Tag management and counts
- **`useElevate()`**: `elevate(articleId)` → `{ ideaId, existing }` and `unElevate(articleId, ideaId?, existing?)` — thin client for the elevate endpoints
- **`useHighlights()`**: `fetchHighlights(articleId)`, `createHighlight(articleId, { quote, note, startOffset, endOffset })`, `deleteHighlight(id)` — thin client for the highlight endpoints (see "Highlights → SFL" below)
- **`useToast()`**: Success/error toasts with auto-dismiss (rendered by `AppToast.vue`)
- **`useAuth()`**: Session state, sign-in/out

Each composable returns reactive state and methods. State is shared across all components that call the same composable. (The old `useKeyboardShortcuts`, `useDeckGesture`, and `useSavedArticlesByTag` composables were deleted in the 2026-06 rebuild — keyboard handling now lives in the pages that own it, and drag physics lives in `motion-v` inside `CardStack`.)

Special values that survived the rebuild: `useArticles().fetchArticles(-1)` fetches saved articles, and `useFeeds().feedsByTag` groups untagged feeds under the `'__inbox__'` key (the Sources page renders it as "Inbox").

### Database Schema Key Points

**Feed-Tag Relationship**: Many-to-many through `FeedTag` join table. Feeds can have multiple tags; the Sources room groups feeds by tag.

**Saved Articles ("the shelf")**: Independent `SavedArticle` table (not a boolean on Article) to support:
- User-specific saved state (multi-user ready)
- Tags on saved articles via `SavedArticleTag`
- Future features like notes

**Highlights ("the yellow pen")**: Independent `Highlight` table (migration `005-highlights.sql`) — one row per marked passage, with `quote`, optional `note`, and plain-text `start_offset`/`end_offset` into the rendered article's `textContent`. `sfl_idea_id` holds the SFL `quote` idea it mirrors to (NULL when SFL failed soft). Independent of the shelf (no `SavedArticle` needed) and does not mark the article read. See "Highlights → SFL" below.

**Cascading Deletes**: All user data cascades on user deletion. Deleting a feed cascades to articles, saved articles, and highlights.

### Component Organization

**Tufte primitives** (`components/tufte/`) — small presentational building blocks every surface composes. Auto-imported with **no path prefix** (configured in `nuxt.config.ts`), so they are `<MonoLabel>`, `<CardFrame>`, etc., NOT `<TufteMonoLabel>`:
- `MonoLabel.vue` - 10px tracked uppercase mono label; `dash` prop adds the leading em-dash (`— SECTION`), `accent` promotes it to the screen's one accent
- `ActionLabel.vue` - **the Tufte substitute for a button**: a bordered mono label, emits `click`; `accent` prop promotes it to the single crimson accent. Use this anywhere a button is needed
- `CardFrame.vue` - hairline-framed raised paper surface (no shadow, no radius) — deck cards, modals, and prompts compose this
- `HairlineRule.vue` - hairline `<hr>` (never boxes); `strong` prop for the heavier rule

**Card deck** (`components/stack/`) — the reading entrance:
- `CardStack.vue` - owns the deck state + motion-v physics, performs the five verbs, exposes `commit(direction)`, `undo()`, and `openTop()` to the page
- `ArticleCard.vue` - a single card (`CardFrame`): full-bleed hero with overlaid headline when an image exists, typographic head otherwise; excerpt + reading time
- `DeckEmptyState.vue` - "all caught up" + Sync all
- `UndoToast.vue` - brief `— UNDO <verb>` affordance after save/read/elevate

**Grid survey view** (`components/grid/`) — the deck's scrollable alternate, toggled from the deck header (see "Grid view" under the Tufte section below):
- `ArticleGrid.vue` - vertically scrollable grid — single full-width column on phones (wider rows read + sort easier), 3-col ≥sm — bound to the **live** unread-and-unsaved list. Owns per-card horizontal swipes (`drag="x"` + `touch-action: pan-y` so vertical pans stay native scroll; one shared `x` MotionValue bound to the active cell via `dragId`), the commit path (← read / → save, optimistic, `resolveGridDirection` from `utils/grid.ts`), a grid-local LIFO undo history + `UndoToast`, tap→reader with the `movedFar` guard, and the IntersectionObserver sentinel that emits `loadMore` (re-observed after each load so a still-visible sentinel fires again). Exposes `undo()` and `commitCard(id, dir)`; **no elevate and no prefetch** (deliberate — see the design notes in the Tufte section)
- `MiniCard.vue` - compact image-led card, responsive to the grid's column count: a horizontal row (fixed `w-28` side thumbnail left, text right) in the 1-col phone grid, stacked (`aspect-[4/3]` hero on top) ≥sm. Thumbnail via `cardImageUrl` (filler filtered) + 3-line headline + `feed · age` mono footer; typographic hairline-head variant when imageless. No excerpt — density is the point

**Shared chrome** (`components/`):
- `DeckScreen.vue` - the entire deck screen (snapshot, keyboard handler, sync, help overlay, and the **deck / grid view toggle**; its `<main>` is `fixed inset-0 overflow-hidden` — the screen contributes no document height, so the page itself never scrolls in deck mode (no iOS rubber-band or URL-bar creep) and grid mode scrolls inside ArticleGrid's own scroller — two mono text-buttons in the header, active word hairline-underlined, mode persisted via `useViewMode()`); optional `tag` prop scopes the deck to one tag and optional `feedId` (+ `title` for the header) scopes it to one feed; emits `not-found` when the tag/feed doesn't exist. In grid mode it mounts `ArticleGrid` on the live filtered list instead of CardStack, forwards `u` to the grid's undo, and leaves arrows/`o`/Enter native (no top card to act on)
- `BottomBar.vue` - fixed bottom room-switcher (Deck / Found / Shelf / Sources); hidden on `/article/*` and `/login`
- `AppToast.vue` - renders `useToast()` state
- `HelpOverlay.vue` - the `?` keyboard-shortcuts card (Teleport + `CardFrame`)
- `TagEditorOverlay.vue` - full-screen tag editor for a feed (Teleport paper sheet — `bg-paper`, no backdrop, no tap-to-dismiss): removable chips + input with autocomplete on existing tags (Enter/comma commit, arrows navigate suggestions, Backspace on empty input removes last chip, Esc cancels via its own window listener). Dumb overlay — takes `feed` + `allTags` props, emits `save(tags)` / `close`; the page owns the API call. Mount with `v-if` so draft state resets per open
- `HighlightNoteOverlay.vue` - full-screen note sheet for a fresh highlight (Teleport paper sheet, mirrors `TagEditorOverlay`): shows the quoted passage + a `<textarea>` for the optional note (`#tags` hint). `#hashtags` light up live as you type — the textarea's text is transparent over a `.note-mirror` div rendering `renderNoteHtml(draft)` (accent + text-shadow fake-bold, since a real weight change would drift the native caret; scroll kept in sync). Takes `quote` + `saving` props, emits `save(note)` / `close`; Cmd/Ctrl+Enter commits, Esc cancels. Mount with `v-if` so the draft resets per open
- `HighlightPopover.vue` - small Teleported `CardFrame` near a tapped mark: renders the note via `renderNoteHtml` (hashtags accent-styled) or "No note", a `— IN SFL` `MonoLabel` when synced, **X / Threads share buttons** (brand glyphs; share the marked passage in curly quotes + the article link via `xQuoteShareUrl` / `threadsQuoteShareUrl`, shown only when `sourceUrl` is set), and a **Remove** `ActionLabel`. Takes `highlight` + `x`/`y` (clamped into the viewport) + optional `sourceUrl`, emits `remove` / `close`
- `PwaUpdatePrompt.vue` - service-worker update prompt

**Pages** (the three rooms + satellites):
- `pages/index.vue` - thin wrapper — mounts `<DeckScreen />` with no props
- `pages/[tag].vue` - tag-scoped deck (`/TAG-NAME`, ASCII case-insensitive); Tufte not-found state for unknown tags; `BottomBar` shows Deck tab active; Nuxt static routes take precedence so `/shelf` etc. are safe
- `pages/feed/[id].vue` - feed-scoped deck (`/feed/:id`); same `DeckScreen` as the tag deck (passes `feedId` + the feed's `title` for the header), resolves the title from `useFeeds()`, Tufte not-found for an unknown/NaN id; `BottomBar` shows Deck tab active. Each feed title on the Sources page links here
- `pages/article/[id].vue` - the full-screen serif reader (auto-fetches full text for thin RSS bodies). It **keeps your place**: the scroll position is saved server-side as a fraction of scrollable height (`Article.read_progress`, `PATCH /api/articles/:id/progress`) — debounced 1.5s on scroll, flushed on unmount and on `visibilitychange` hidden (the last signal an iOS PWA gets) — and restored on re-entry after the body settles. Pure logic in `utils/readingPosition.ts` (unit-tested): restore only in the 3%–95% band (a barely-started or finished article reopens at the top), skip writes under a 1% delta. Also owns **highlighting**: selecting text shows a floating `— HIGHLIGHT` pill (or press `h`) → `HighlightNoteOverlay` → paints a yellow `<mark>`; tapping a mark opens `HighlightPopover`. On mount (after the body settles) it fetches + paints stored highlights; a `watch(sanitizedContent)` re-anchors them after the one-time full-text re-render. The bottom of the article carries X / Threads **share** buttons inline beside "Mark as read" (`v-if="article.url"`): non-accent `ActionLabel`s with brand glyphs that open the public web-intent compose URLs built by `utils/share.ts` (`xShareUrl` puts title in `text` + link in `url`; `threadsShareUrl` puts **only** the link in `text` since Threads has no `url` param and renders the bare link as a card — pure + unit-tested) in a new tab. No SDKs, no tracking. Non-accent so the lone crimson stays on "Mark as read"
- `pages/shelf.vue` - saved articles as hairline rows with a flat tag filter
- `pages/sources.vue` - add/manage feeds grouped by tag (tag editing via `TagEditorOverlay`), sync all, account footer
- `pages/login.vue`, `pages/mcp-settings.vue`

### API Routes Structure

Routes follow REST conventions:

**Feeds**:
- `GET /api/feeds` - List user's feeds with unread counts
- `POST /api/feeds` - Add new feed (discovers and fetches initial articles)
- `POST /api/feeds/discover` - Discover RSS feeds from a URL
- `POST /api/feeds/add-smart` - Add a feed with smarter discovery
- `GET /api/feeds/:id` - Single feed
- `DELETE /api/feeds/:id` - Delete feed
- `POST /api/feeds/:id/refresh` - Manually refresh a feed
- `PATCH /api/feeds/:id/tags` - Update feed tags

**Articles**:
- `GET /api/articles` - List articles with filtering (feedId, feedIds, isRead, tag (case-insensitive ASCII; 404 if unknown; empty list if tag has no feeds))
- `GET /api/articles/:id` - Single article with full content
- `PATCH /api/articles/:id/read` - Mark article as read/unread
- `PATCH /api/articles/:id/progress` - Save the reading position `{ progress: 0..1 }` (fraction of scrollable height; clamped server-side)
- `POST /api/articles/mark-all-read` - Bulk mark as read
- `DELETE /api/articles/:id/delete` - Delete article (the route file is `[id]/delete.delete.ts`; note the `/delete` suffix — there is no bare `DELETE /api/articles/:id`)
- `POST /api/articles/:id/save` - Save article (shelf)
- `DELETE /api/articles/:id/save` - Unsave article
- `POST /api/articles/:id/elevate` - Elevate to SFL (creates a page idea, marks read) — see "Elevate to SFL"
- `DELETE /api/articles/:id/elevate` - Undo an elevate (no body/params — the idea to delete is read from `Article.sfl_idea_id`, set by the elevate; DELETE bodies are dropped by the Workers entry anyway)
- `POST /api/articles/:id/fetch-fulltext` - Fetch + store full article body (RSS often gives only excerpts)
- `POST /api/articles/fetch-fulltext-bulk` - Batch full-text fetch
- `POST /api/articles/manual` - Add a manual (non-RSS) article

**Highlights** (see "Highlights → SFL"):
- `GET /api/articles/:id/highlights` - List the article's highlights (ordered by `start_offset`)
- `POST /api/articles/:id/highlights` - Create a highlight `{ quote, note, startOffset, endOffset }` → SFL `quote` idea + local row
- `DELETE /api/highlights/:id` - Delete a highlight (id in path, no body) + its SFL idea

**Saved Articles**:
- `GET /api/saved-articles` - List user's saved articles (optional tag filter)
- `GET /api/saved-articles/counts` - Saved counts
- `PATCH /api/saved-articles/:id/tags` - Update saved article tags

**Tags**:
- `GET /api/tags` - List user's tags with usage counts
- `POST /api/tags` - Create tag
- `PATCH /api/tags/:id` - Update tag
- `DELETE /api/tags/:id` - Delete tag

**Sync**:
- `POST /api/sync` - Sync all active feeds for the user

**Ingest** (the "Found" feed — see "Found feed (social bookmarks)"):
- `POST /api/ingest` - Generic, source-agnostic seam. MCP-authed. Body `{ source, externalId, url, title, author?, content?, summary?, imageUrl?, publishedAt? }` → resolves/creates the user's `kind='found'` feed and inserts an unread article (guid = `${source}:${externalId}`, idempotent). Does **not** save or mark read.

### Found feed (social bookmarks)

A push-only feed (`Feed.kind='found'`, `is_active=0`) that collects bookmarks/saves from social sources — X bookmarks today, more later. It behaves like any other feed (its unread articles flow into the main Deck and it lists under Sources) **and** has a dedicated **Found** tab in `BottomBar` (`pages/found.vue` → a `DeckScreen` scoped to the Found feed; the five verbs work, so swipe-up elevates a found item straight into SFL→wiki).

- **Reader stays source-agnostic.** All source-specific logic lives in Sleeper-side collectors that normalize each item and POST to `/api/ingest`. Adding a new source = a new collector, zero Reader changes. `Article.source` records per-item origin (`'x-bookmark'`, `'bluesky'`, `'mastodon'`, `'reddit'`, `'instapaper'`, `'ai-digest'`, `'sleeper-articles'`, …). Seven collectors ship today (all Sleeper-only, like `feed-candidates.mjs`); each reads Reader creds from `~/.config/reader/env` (`READER_API_URL` + `READER_MCP_TOKEN`). Five normalize *one social item → one card*; the AI digest reads *many* SFL ideas and synthesizes *one* card; the Sleeper Articles collector mirrors *one already-extracted article → one card*.
- **X collector**: `scripts/x-bookmark-sync.mjs`. Refreshes the X OAuth2 user token (rotates + persists), pages newest-first through @phareim's bookmarks (stops once caught up to already-seen ids; bounded by `FIRST_PAGE=25` / `--max-pages`), renders each new tweet to HTML **with quoted + reply/thread context** (carried in one call via expansions — no extra per-tweet X cost), POSTs as `source=x-bookmark`. A bookmarked **native X Article** (long-form) is detected via the `article` tweet field (requested alongside `article.cover_media,article.media_entities` expansions) and rendered from `article.{title,plain_text,preview_text,cover_media}` as a full formatted article (title + cover + body) instead of the bare `t.co` link the tweet `text` would otherwise carry — `renderArticle()` branches off the top of `renderTweet()`. `plain_text` carries no block structure, so `articleBody()` reconstructs headings heuristically (short, few-word line with no terminal punctuation → `<h2>`, else `<p>`). Config in `~/.config/x-bookmarks/{env,token.json,state.json}` (OAuth2 user token minted once via PKCE with `bookmark.read`; `state.json` seeded with the 299 pre-existing bookmarks). X bills per post returned ($0.005). Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--max-pages N`.
- **Bluesky collector**: `scripts/bluesky-bookmark-sync.mjs`. Lowest-friction — free app password, no OAuth dance, no per-call cost. Opens/refreshes an AT Protocol session (`createSession`/`refreshSession`), pages newest-first through native bookmarks (`app.bsky.bookmark.getBookmarks`), renders each from the hydrated `postView` (text + images + quoted post + link card, no extra fetches), POSTs as `source=bluesky` with `externalId` = the post `at://` URI. Config in `~/.config/bluesky/{env,token.json,state.json}` — `env` holds `BLUESKY_IDENTIFIER`, `BLUESKY_APP_PASSWORD`, optional `BLUESKY_PDS`. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--max-pages N`.
- **Mastodon collector**: `scripts/mastodon-bookmark-sync.mjs`. Free + friction-light like Bluesky — auth is a personal access token (`read:bookmarks` scope), no OAuth dance. Pages `GET /api/v1/bookmarks` following the `Link: rel="next"` header (Mastodon paginates bookmarks by an internal bookmark id only exposed there, not the status id), renders each Status from the object (HTML content + media + boosted `reblog` + link `card`), POSTs as `source=mastodon` with `externalId` = status id. Config in `~/.config/mastodon/{env,state.json}` — `env` holds `MASTODON_INSTANCE` + `MASTODON_ACCESS_TOKEN`. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--max-pages N`.
- **Reddit collector**: `scripts/reddit-saved-sync.mjs`. Reddit's analog to bookmarks is the **saved** list (saved posts AND comments). OAuth2 "script" app password grant (mints a fresh ~1h token per run — no refresh bookkeeping), pages `GET /user/{username}/saved` with `raw_json=1` following the `after` cursor, renders `t3` posts (title/selftext/preview image/external link) and `t1` comments (body + thread title) from the listing. POSTs as `source=reddit` with `externalId` = the fullname (`t3_…`/`t1_…`). Requires a unique `User-Agent` (Reddit 429s without one). Config in `~/.config/reddit/{env,state.json}` — `env` holds `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`, `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`, `REDDIT_USERNAME`, `REDDIT_PASSWORD`, optional `REDDIT_USER_AGENT`. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--max-pages N`.
- **Instapaper collector**: `scripts/instapaper-sync.mjs`. Natural fit (a save-for-later service). OAuth 1.0a **xAuth** (HMAC-SHA1 signing hand-rolled with `node:crypto`, verified against the `oauth-1.0a` vector), `bookmarks/list` on a folder (default `unread`), best-effort `bookmarks/get_text` for full article bodies, POSTs as `source=instapaper` with `externalId` = `bookmark_id`. Config in `~/.config/instapaper/{env,token.json,state.json}`. **Gated** on a consumer key/secret from Instapaper's human-reviewed [request form](https://www.instapaper.com/main/request_oauth_consumer_token) — throws until present, so the timer is harmless meanwhile. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--folder NAME`, `--no-text`.
- **AI digest collector**: `scripts/ai-digest-sync.mjs`. The odd one out — reads *many → one*. Pulls the last ~26h of SFL ideas tagged `ai-news` (`GET /api/ideas?tag=ai-news` — reads the **tag**, not the producing job, so the recurring AI-discovery job can evolve underneath it), asks an LLM (**Venice.ai** OpenAI-compatible API, model `zai-org-glm-5-2`, plain `fetch`, no SDK dep) for a calm editor's-letter HTML digest grouped into 2–4 themes with each claim linked to its source, and POSTs **one** card as `source=ai-digest` with `externalId=<YYYY-MM-DD>` (guid `ai-digest:<date>`, idempotent per day). glm reasons before answering, so the call sets `venice_parameters.disable_thinking`+`strip_thinking_response`; `extractFragment()` strips any reasoning preamble/fence. `ai-news` ideas are mostly `type:note` with `url=null` (source link in the body) — `sourceUrl()` recovers it, `unwrapDeadLinks()` strips any `href="#"` the model invents. Empty window → posts nothing; LLM failure → deterministic linked-list fallback. Config in `~/.config/ai-digest/{env,state.json}` — `env` holds `SFL_API_URL`, `SFL_API_KEY`, `VENICE_API_KEY` (falls back to shell `VENICE_API_TOKEN`), optional `DIGEST_MODEL`/`VENICE_API_URL`/`DIGEST_WINDOW_HOURS`. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--window-hours N`, `--date YYYY-MM-DD`. Design: [`docs/found-feed-ai-digest.md`](docs/found-feed-ai-digest.md).
- **Sleeper Articles collector**: `scripts/sleeper-articles-sync.mjs`. Mirrors the Sleeper Articles service (`~/chat/articles` — the SFL-bookmark extraction pipeline on `127.0.0.1:3003`) into Found. Reads *one already-extracted article → one card*: pages the articles list newest-first (`GET /?status=ready&cursor=…`, cursor pagination via `next_cursor`/`has_more`), stopping once a page is not entirely new (bounded by `--page-size`/`--max-pages`/`--max-items`), then fetches each new item's full doc (`GET /:id` — the list view strips `content_md`) and renders **by kind**: `article`/`digest` bodies via a vendored dependency-free Markdown→HTML converter (`mdToHtml`, since `marked` isn't a Reader dep), `video` as a thumbnail+link card, `post` as an X-style card from `doc.post_data`. POSTs as `source=sleeper-articles` with `externalId=<article id>` (guid `sleeper-articles:<id>`, idempotent). The list/read endpoints are public today, so `ARTICLES_API_KEY` is optional. **The Articles service already holds hundreds of ready items**, so `--seed` marks the current backlog seen without ingesting (run once to establish a baseline — done 2026-07-01, 500 seeded + 3 test cards kept); normal runs then pull only genuinely new articles. Config in `~/.config/sleeper-articles/{env,state.json}` — `env` holds `ARTICLES_API_URL` (default `http://127.0.0.1:3003`) + optional `ARTICLES_API_KEY`. Flags: `--dry-run`, `--verbose`, `--seed`, `--page-size N`, `--max-pages N`, `--max-items N`. Note this partly overlaps upstream sources: these articles originate from SFL bookmarks, and Reader's swipe-up elevate writes *back* to SFL — dedup is by guid, but the same X post can appear both as an `x-bookmark` card and a `sleeper-articles` `post` card.
- **Schedules**: systemd **user** timers (`Persistent=true`, units vendored under `scripts/systemd/`). The five social collectors run twice daily staggered (07/19:30·40·50, 08/20:00·10); the Sleeper Articles collector runs twice daily at 08/20:20; the AI digest runs once at 06:30 (first in Found at breakfast). `journalctl --user -u <name>` to tail; `systemctl --user start <name>.service` to run now.
- **Full reference + native-app integration spec**: [`docs/found-feed.md`](docs/found-feed.md).

### Removed surfaces (2026-06 rebuild)

The AI features were torn out with the UX rebuild: newsletter-style summaries (`/api/articles/summarize`), per-tag summaries (`/api/tags/:name/summary`), the one-shot `/api/claude` endpoint, and the Unsplash fallback image endpoint are all **gone**. `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are no longer needed, and the Worker has no `AI` binding. Legacy article rows may still carry Unsplash filler image URLs from the old feed parser — `utils/cardData.ts` (`cardImageUrl`) filters them client-side; never show them. (Full-text fetch also replaces filler/missing `image_url` server-side with the page's og:image when it runs — see "Full-text fetching".)

### Elevate to SFL

The swipe-up verb promotes an article into the SFL idea tracker (sfl.hareim.no), which the wider knowledge pipeline (sleeper-articles → thoughts/wiki) polls downstream.

- **Server client**: `server/utils/sfl.ts` — `createPageIdea` / `deleteIdea` against `${NUXT_SFL_API_URL}/api/ideas` with Bearer auth, 10s timeouts, response-shape validation. SFL **dedupes page ideas by URL**: POSTing an existing URL returns `{ existing: true, idea }` instead of creating.
- **Route contract**: `POST /api/articles/:id/elevate` creates the SFL idea, then marks the article read (mirroring `read.patch.ts`) **and records the idea id in `Article.sfl_idea_id` — but only when it created the idea (`!existing`); a pre-existing idea is stored as NULL, since it is not ours to delete**; if the local DB write fails it compensates by deleting the idea it just created (only when `!existing`). Returns `{ success, ideaId, existing }`. `DELETE /api/articles/:id/elevate` takes **no body or params** — it reads `Article.sfl_idea_id` back (scoped to the caller's own article) and deletes that idea, so the delete never trusts a client-supplied id (mirrors `Highlight.sfl_idea_id`; a DELETE body would crash the Worker anyway, as Nitro's cloudflare-module entry only buffers post/put/patch). Present ⇒ ours to delete, so undo needs no `existing` flag. Then marks the article unread and clears the column. (The client's `unElevate` still sends `?ideaId=&existing=` for backward-compat; the server ignores them.)
- **Client semantics**: elevate is **non-optimistic** — `CardStack` holds the card mid-air while SFL answers and springs it back on failure ("Could not reach SFL — card kept"). The deck history entry records `ideaId` + `ideaExisting` so undo can reverse correctly.
- **Config**: `NUXT_SFL_API_URL` (set in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]` for prod, `.env.local` for dev) and `NUXT_SFL_API_KEY` (dev: `.env.local`; prod: `wrangler secret put NUXT_SFL_API_KEY`). When either is missing the endpoints 503 ("SFL is not configured") and the UI fails soft.

### Highlights → SFL

The yellow-pen verb saves a *specific passage* (not the whole article) to SFL as a self-contained `quote` idea. Shares the SFL config above.

- **Anchoring**: a highlight is stored as plain-text `start_offset`/`end_offset` into the rendered article's `textContent` (the processed `sanitizedContent` is deterministic) plus the exact `quote` string. `utils/highlightDom.ts` (pure, jsdom-tested) does the DOM work: `getSelectionOffsets` (selection → offsets), `paintHighlight` (wrap the range in `<mark class="hl" data-hl-id>`, splitting across element boundaries; falls back to `textContent.indexOf(quote)` when offsets drift after the full-text re-render), `unpaint`, `clearHighlights`.
- **Hashtags**: `#words` in the note become **real SFL tags**. `utils/hashtags.ts` (pure, shared client+server): `extractHashtags` (unicode-aware, deduped, lowercased) and `renderNoteHtml` (escape + wrap `#tag` in an accent span for the popover). The `#word` also stays visible in the note text.
- **Server client** (`server/utils/sfl.ts`, alongside the elevate helpers): `createQuoteIdea` posts `{ type:'quote', title:<quote≤120>, summary:note, data:{ text, note, source_url, source_title } }` with **no `url`** (quote dedup is url-scoped; we want many quotes per article). `findOrCreateTag` (GET `/api/tags` match-by-title, else POST a `type:'tag'` idea) + `tagIdea` (POST `/api/connections` `label:'tagged_with'`, swallows the 400 "already exists") mirror the canonical `~/sfl-hook` convention. Both are **best-effort** — a tag failure never fails the highlight.
- **Route contract**: `POST /api/articles/:id/highlights` creates the quote idea, promotes hashtags to tags, then inserts the local `Highlight` row. **Fails soft**: if `getSflConfig` 503s (SFL unconfigured) the mark is still stored locally with `sfl_idea_id = NULL`; any *other* SFL error (network/timeout) is surfaced. `DELETE /api/highlights/:id` (id in path — no DELETE body, per the Workers entry) deletes the local row and the SFL idea when one exists.
- **Client semantics**: **non-optimistic** — the page awaits the server id before painting the mark (`saveHighlight` in `pages/article/[id].vue`). Independent of the shelf and does **not** mark the article read.

### Feed-candidate report (Sleeper only)

`node scripts/feed-candidates.mjs` mines the SFL save stream (`~/chat/articles/data/articles.db`) for domains worth subscribing to, weighted by thoughts-wiki provenance folds (`~/thoughts/sync/provenance.json` + raw frontmatter), excludes domains already subscribed (via `GET /api/feeds`), and probes survivors for working RSS/Atom feeds. Reader API auth from `~/.config/reader/env` (`READER_API_URL` + `READER_MCP_TOKEN`). Runs monthly via recurring sleeper-task #73 (`DO-PADDLE-CRISPED-CLASP`, cron `0 8 1 * *`), which posts the shortlist as a task comment — it never auto-subscribes. Flags: `--json`, `--min-score N` (default 4).

### Key Patterns

**Authentication**: `getOptionalUser()` is the core auth primitive — it resolves MCP token (via `X-MCP-Token` header) or session cookie, returning `null` if unauthenticated. `getAuthenticatedUser()` wraps it and throws 401. Use `toPublicUser(user)` from `server/utils/auth.ts` to shape user objects for API responses. Password hashing in `server/utils/password.ts` (PBKDF2 via Web Crypto, constant-time comparison), session management in `server/utils/session.ts`, client composable in `composables/useAuth.ts`. Auth API routes: `POST /api/auth/sign-in`, `POST /api/auth/sign-up`, `POST /api/auth/sign-out`, `GET /api/auth/session`.

**Database Access**: Use `getD1()` from `~/server/utils/cloudflare` to query data and `getArticleBucket()` for article content (R2). Both read `event.context.cloudflare.env` and throw a 500 if the binding is missing — so they only work inside a request handler with the Cloudflare runtime (i.e. via `npm run dev`/`preview` or deployed, not in a bare Node script). Table names are quoted PascalCase in SQL (`"Feed"`, `"Article"`), and every query is scoped by `user_id`. D1's `.run()` reports insert metadata under `meta` — read ids/changes via `lastRowId()` / `rowsChanged()` from `server/utils/d1Result.ts`, never `result.lastRowId` (always undefined on D1). Worker invocations are capped at 1000 subrequests; storing article content costs ~3 per article, which is why per-sync intake defaults to 100 (`MAX_ARTICLES_PER_FEED` overrides).

**Feed Parsing**: Use `parseFeed()` from `server/utils/feedParser.ts` (wraps `@extractus/feed-extractor`). Feed favicons come from Google's S2 favicon service (`https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?domain=…`) derived from the feed's domain — NOT Unsplash (that fallback was removed). Lead images come from `extractImageUrl()` in `server/utils/feedImage.ts` (pure, unit-tested): image enclosure → media:content/media:thumbnail (incl. inside YouTube's media:group) → itunes:image → first `<img>` in the body. feed-extractor parses XML with fast-xml-parser, so element attributes arrive as `@_url`/`@_type`/`@_href` and repeated elements as arrays — never read the xml2js `$.url` shape.

**Feed Sync**: Use `syncSingleFeed()` from `server/utils/feedSync.ts` for syncing a single feed (shared by both `/api/sync` and `/api/feeds/:id/refresh`).

**Tag Operations**: Use `getOrCreateTag()` from `server/utils/tags.ts` for get-or-create tag pattern (shared by feed tags, saved article tags, and manual article endpoints).

**Toast Messages**: Use `useToast()` composable for success/error messages with auto-dismiss; `AppToast.vue` (mounted in `app.vue`) renders them. Do not use raw refs with setTimeout.

**HTML Sanitization**: Use `processArticleContent()` from `utils/processArticleContent.ts` (DOMPurify allowlist + forcing `target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"` on links) before rendering article HTML — done client-side in `pages/article/[id].vue`. It first runs `looksLikePlainText` / `paragraphize` from `utils/paragraphize.ts` so legacy plain-text R2 blobs render paragraphed. Display-time DOMPurify is the security boundary — there is deliberately no server-side sanitization.

**Full-text fetching**: RSS items frequently carry only an excerpt. `server/utils/fulltext.ts` (`fetchFullText`) fetches the source URL (15s timeout, browser UA), extracts **rich HTML** via `server/utils/extractContent.ts` — Mozilla Readability on a `linkedom/worker` DOM (import the `/worker` entry, NOT bare `linkedom`: it's the Workers-safe ESM build), with a `<base href>` injected so relative URLs resolve against the article URL, lazy `data-src` images promoted, and the old regex pipeline kept as a `paragraphize`d plain-text fallback — and stores the body in R2 via `article-content.ts`. `extractContent.ts` is pure (no D1/R2/h3 imports) so Jest tests it directly (`__tests__/server/extractContent.test.ts`; under Jest, `linkedom/worker` is mapped to the CJS entry in `jest.config.js`). The reader auto-triggers fetch when the stored body is **thin** (under ~1200 visible chars) **or truncated** — `utils/truncation.ts` (`looksTruncated`, pure + unit-tested) detects a feed "read-more" footer (Ars Technica's trailing `<a>Read full article</a>`, FeedBurner's "Continue reading", a `[…]` bracket, or a short trailing anchor pointing back at the article's own URL) so a multi-paragraph excerpt that clears the length gate still upgrades. Neither path fires when `full_text_status` is `failed`, `skipped`, or already `fetched`, or when the article's feed is `kind='found'` (the GET response carries `feedKind`) — Found items are pushed fully rendered by a collector, and fetching their source URL (an X post, say) would only scrape a JS shell; `POST /api/articles/:id/fetch-fulltext` enforces the same guard server-side (marks the row `skipped`), and the bulk endpoint excludes found feeds in SQL. The reader also silently re-fetches once when a stored body is tag-less legacy plain text (unless failed/skipped) to upgrade it to rich HTML. **Extraction never blindly overwrites the stored body**: `acceptExtraction` (in `extractContent.ts`, pure, unit-tested) rejects a result that is still thin (<1200 visible chars) while missing the page's own lead image (Readability latching onto page chrome — xkcd's footer instead of the comic), that trades an image-bearing body for an imageless one, or that carries less visible text than what's already stored; a rejected extraction returns `skipped` and keeps the original (`fetchFullText` reads the existing body via the article's `contentKey`, which both routes now pass). When extraction finds nothing but the page has a lead image and the stored body is empty, the image itself becomes the body (`<p><img></p>` — comics like Oglaf, where the strip *is* the article). Since we already hold the page HTML, `fetchFullText` also backfills the card image (even when the body is rejected): `extractLeadImage` (in `extractContent.ts`, pure, unit-tested) takes og:image / twitter:image from the head (relative URLs resolved, non-http schemes rejected), else the first `<img>` of the extracted content, and the D1 update sets `image_url` only when it is NULL, empty, or legacy Unsplash filler — a real RSS image is never overwritten. `fetchFullText` returns the resulting `imageUrl` (read back after the update) and the `POST /api/articles/:id/fetch-fulltext` response carries it, so a caller can update a card in place without re-fetching the whole article.

**Comic/image-led feeds**: feed-extractor's `normalization` **strips HTML from the entry body**, so feeds without `content:encoded` (xkcd, SMBC, Oglaf — RSS `description` or Atom `content`/`summary` only) used to lose their `<img>` at sync time, leaving a thin text scrap that forced the (hopeless) full-text path. `parseFeed` now captures the raw markup via `getExtraEntryFields` (`descriptionHtml`, with `rawEntryText` handling fast-xml-parser's `{'#text': …}` shape) and prefers it over the normalized description, so a comic card carries its comic straight from the feed.

**Deck prefetch (peek warming)**: `CardStack` watches the card directly *behind* the top one (`deckIds[1]`) and calls `useArticles().prefetchArticle(id)` as the deck shifts. That fires the full-text fetch in the background so, by the time the card is promoted or opened, its og:image has backfilled `imageUrl` (an imageless RSS card gains a picture in the peek) and its body is in R2 (opening is instant). It is deduped (a session `Set` in `useState`) and **gated** — skipped when the card already has a usable image (`cardImageUrl`) or its `fullTextStatus` is already `fetched`/`failed`/`skipped` — so it never spends a round-trip for nothing; hence the list endpoint (`GET /api/articles`) now returns `fullTextStatus` alongside the still-`null` `content`. Best-effort and fire-and-forget: a failure leaves the id in the deduped set (a flaky page isn't hammered on every shuffle) and the reader still fetches on open.

**Optimistic Updates**: Save, mark-read, and skip update local state immediately (elevate deliberately does not — see above). When using `useState` with `Set`, always replace the Set (create a new one) rather than mutating in place, since Vue's reactivity doesn't track Set mutations.

**Date Formatting**: Use `formatRelativeDate()` from `utils/formatDate.ts` for relative time display (e.g., "5 minutes ago"). Do not create local formatDate functions in components.

### Keyboard Shortcuts

There is no global shortcut composable — each page owns its handler (with guards: modifier keys other than shift are ignored, and keys are swallowed when focus is in an input/textarea/contentEditable).

**Deck (`components/DeckScreen.vue`, mounted by `/` and `/TAG-NAME`)** — arrows drive the same `CardStack.commit(direction)` path as swipes:
- `←` - Mark the top card read
- `→` - Save (shelf) the top card
- `↑` - Elevate to SFL
- `↓` - Skip (move card to back of deck)
- `o` / `Enter` - Open the reader for the top card (via `CardStack.openTop()` — the page's deck snapshot goes stale after commits)
- `u` - Undo the last verb
- `?` - Toggle the help overlay (`HelpOverlay.vue`; `Esc` closes it — takes a `mode` prop so the key table matches the active view)
- `shift+r` - Sync all feeds

**Grid mode** (same handler, branched on `useViewMode()`): only `u` (forwards to `ArticleGrid.undo()`), `?`, and `shift+r` are handled. Arrows and `o`/`Enter` deliberately do nothing and don't `preventDefault` — ArrowUp/Down scroll the grid natively, and there is no top card for verbs to act on. Verbs on grid cards are horizontal swipes (← read / → save) and tap-to-open.

**Reader (`pages/article/[id].vue`)**:
- `Esc` / `Backspace` - Back (or close the highlight popover when one is open)
- `s` - Save/unsave (shelf)
- `r` - Mark read and return to the deck (also the accent "Mark as read" button at the end of the article)
- `e` - Elevate to SFL
- `v` - Open the original in a new tab
- `h` - Highlight the current selection (opens the note overlay; no-op without a selection)

While the note overlay is open it owns its own keys (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter saves, Esc cancels); the page handler defers to it.

### Styling Notes

- **Tufte Viz aesthetic throughout** (see the dedicated section below): warm paper / dark paper, ET Book serif body, hairline 1px rules (never card shadows or rounded buttons), exactly **one crimson accent per screen** — during a drag that accent is the pending-verb label. The lone sanctioned exception is the **yellow highlighter** (`--highlight` token in `tufte.css`, `mark.hl` rule in `main.css`): a deliberate *second* mark colour for saved passages — crimson stays reserved for the active verb/pill.
- Dark mode is **system-preference** (`darkMode: 'media'` in `tailwind.config.js`); the dark palette lives in `assets/css/tufte.css` under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. There is no manual theme toggle. Prefer the token utilities (`bg-paper`, `bg-paper-raised`, `text-ink`, `text-body`, `text-mute`, `text-accent-ink`, `border-rule`, `font-serif`, `max-w-measure`) over `dark:` variants and never reintroduce `blue-*`, `bg-gray-*`, rounded buttons, or shadows.
- Reader prose uses `@tailwindcss/typography`, restyled in `tailwind.config.js` to ET Book / 65ch / accent links / hairline rules.
- Interactive mono-label buttons should carry a `focus-visible` outline (Tailwind `focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-1` or a scoped `:focus-visible { outline: 1px solid var(--tufte-accent); }`).

### Tufte Viz Design System & Card Deck

The entire UX is a ground-up build in the **Tufte Viz design system** (warm paper, ET Book serif, hairline rules, one accent). Build plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-06-09-tufte-reader-rebuild.md`. Canonical system: the `tufte-viz` skill at `~/github/skill-tufte-viz/`.

**Vendoring** (the design system can't be reached at runtime on the deployed Worker):
- `public/tufte/fonts/` — ET Book woff files (roman / italic / bold) + license
- `assets/css/tufte.css` — `@font-face`, the `--tufte-*` base tokens, semantic aliases (`--text-*`, `--surface-*`, `--border-*`), and the dark palette under `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`. Loaded first in `nuxt.config.ts` `css` so `main.css` can override.
- `config/tufte.preset.cjs` — the Tailwind preset (added to `tailwind.config.js` `presets`) exposing the token utilities (`paper`, `ink`, `body`, `mute`, `accent`, `rule`, `measure`, …)
- `app.vue` sets `bg-paper text-ink font-serif` and mounts `BottomBar` + `AppToast` + `PwaUpdatePrompt`

**App icon** (`scripts/gen_icon.py`): the Do/Write/Sleep family mark — an ET Book "R" in ink above the rust rule on aged paper. Forked from `~/github/write/Write/scripts/gen_icon.py`, with the family's American Typewriter swapped for the vendored ET Book bold (converted woff→ttf via fontTools at run time). Regenerating writes `public/{pwa-192x192,pwa-512x512,apple-touch-icon,favicon}.png` — full-bleed opaque squares (platforms mask their own corners); needs a venv with `pillow` + `fonttools` (instructions in the script header). The old blue-book `favicon.svg` / `apple-touch-icon.svg` and their `sharp`-based generator are gone.

**Four rooms**, switched by `BottomBar.vue`: the **Deck** (`/`, the card stack of unread articles), the **Found** room (`/found`, social bookmarks — a `DeckScreen` scoped to the Found feed; see "Found feed (social bookmarks)"), the **Shelf** (`/shelf`, saved articles), and **Sources** (`/sources`, feed management + account). The reader (`/article/:id`) and login sit outside the bar. Tag group headers on the Sources page link to `/TAG-NAME`; tag routes show the Deck room active in `BottomBar`.

**The five verbs** — one interaction model on touch and keys, all routed through `CardStack.commit(direction)`:

| Gesture / key | Verb | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| swipe ← / `←` | **Mark read** | optimistic: fling, advance, `markAsRead(id, true).catch(toast)` |
| swipe → / `→` | **Save** (shelf) | optimistic: fling, advance, `saveArticle().catch(toast)` |
| swipe ↑ / `↑` | **Elevate** to SFL | **non-optimistic**: card holds mid-air awaiting SFL, springs back on failure; on success also marks read |
| swipe ↓ / `↓` | **Skip** | `advance` rotates the id to the back of the deck (no API call) |
| tap / `o` / `Enter` | **Open** the reader | navigate `/article/:id` (non-destructive, card stays) |

`u` / the `— UNDO` toast reverses the last destructive verb: unsave, mark-unread, or un-elevate (which deletes the SFL idea **only** when the elevate created it — `ideaExisting` entries are left alone — then marks unread).

**Physics** (`motion-v` inside `CardStack.vue`): the top card is a `motion.div` with `drag` + `drag-snap-to-origin`; its `x`/`y` are MotionValues and `rotate` is a transform of `x` (max ±9°). All visible cards render through one keyed branch so a promoted card keeps its component instance and springs into place. Tunables live in `utils/deck.ts` `DECK` (distance/velocity thresholds, dominance ratio, spring/fling configs). Commit resolution = distance OR a same-direction flick, dominant axis only (`resolveDirection`). The pending verb fades in as the one accent during the drag.

**Pure logic** (unit-tested, no DOM):
- `utils/deck.ts` — `resolveDirection(dx, dy, vx, vy)`, `advance(deck, action)`, `undo(deck, history)`, `DECK` constants, `DeckHistoryEntry` (carries `ideaId`/`ideaExisting` for elevate)
- `utils/grid.ts` — `resolveGridDirection(dx, dy, vx)` (horizontal commit resolution gated on horizontal-over-vertical dominance — a diagonal release is a scroll, never a commit), `nextPageOffset(articles, savedIds, extraOffset)` (pagination under a shrinking unread window), `dedupeAppend(existing, page)`, `GRID` constants (page size 24, 110px distance threshold, 2.0 dominance ratio, sentinel margin)
- `utils/cardData.ts` — `stripHtml`, `readingTimeMinutes` (220 wpm, null for thin excerpt bodies), `cardImageUrl` (filters legacy Unsplash filler), `excerpt`

**The deck-snapshot pattern** (`components/DeckScreen.vue`): the component passes CardStack a **snapshot** (`deckArticles = [...unreadArticles.value]`), deliberately not the live computed — `markAsRead` optimistically flips `isRead`, which would shrink a computed deck on every right-swipe, retrigger CardStack's refill watcher, and wipe the deck + undo history mid-session. The deck refills only on load, explicit sync, and returning from grid mode (all explicit boundaries); the header's unread count stays live via CardStack's `@count` emit. Anything needing the *current* top card must ask CardStack (e.g. `openTop()`), not the snapshot.

**Grid view** (the deck's scrollable alternate, `components/grid/` + `useViewMode()`): a survey mode — a 1-col list of row-layout `MiniCard`s on phones, a 3-col grid of stacked cards ≥sm — for looking over many articles at once, toggled from the deck header and persisted in localStorage. Deliberate contrasts with the deck:
- **Binds the live list** (`unreadArticles` filtered by `savedArticleIds`), not a snapshot — a consumed card *should* leave a survey view, and undo re-inserts it automatically at its published-order position. The grid keeps its own LIFO undo history (no deck order to restore).
- **Verbs**: horizontal swipe ← read / → save (optimistic, same semantics as the deck; `resolveGridDirection` with the deck's 110px distance/600 velocity thresholds plus a **stricter dominance gate** — horizontal must beat vertical 2:1 (deck is 1.4), since a grid cell shares the surface with the scroller; the pending accent label obeys the same rule), tap opens the reader. **No elevate** (vertical gestures belong to scrolling — elevate stays deck-only) and **no skip** (scrolling past *is* skipping). The gesture split is `drag="x"` + `touch-action: pan-y` per cell, with one shared `x` MotionValue bound to the active cell only.
- **Paged loading**: first page stays `limit: 100` (shared with deck mode — toggling must not hand the deck a thin stack); past that, an IntersectionObserver sentinel loads pages of `GRID.PAGE_SIZE` (24) via `useArticles().loadMoreArticles()`. Because the list is fetched `isRead=false&excludeSaved=true`, marking cards read shifts the server window — the next offset is the **count of fetched rows still matching** (`nextPageOffset`), appended pages are deduped by id, and an all-duplicate page bumps `extraOffset` so the loop terminates. The saved-articles path (`fetchArticles(-1)`) resets `lastQuery`/`hasMore` so the shelf is never paginated.
- **No prefetch** (deliberate): the deck warms exactly one card; a grid shows 6–12 and scrolls, so visibility-driven full-text prefetch would burn external fetches + R2 writes (~3 subrequests each against the Worker's 1000 cap) on cards never opened. Imageless cards degrade to the typographic variant; the reader still fetches on open.
- **Header count** in grid mode: `max(gridArticles.length, total − consumed)` — honest about unfetched pages, live as cards leave.

**Race guards** in `CardStack`: `commit` no-ops while `busy` (an in-flight commit) or `dragging`; `performUndo` no-ops while `busy`; `applyAdvance` verifies the expected top id before mutating. `settleWithin()` races every awaited animation against a 1.2s timeout because motion-dom's `JSAnimation.finished` never resolves when an animation is stopped (e.g. a pointer re-grab) — without it `busy` could wedge forever.

### Environment Variables

No auth-specific env vars required — sessions use the D1 database directly. Copy `.env.example` → `.env.local`.

```bash
# Feed parsing (optional)
FETCH_TIMEOUT=30000
MAX_ARTICLES_PER_FEED=200

# SFL elevate (swipe-up). Fails soft (503 + toast) if unset.
NUXT_SFL_API_URL="https://sfl-api.aiwdm.workers.dev"
NUXT_SFL_API_KEY="..."
```

In production, `NUXT_SFL_API_URL` is set in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]`; `NUXT_SFL_API_KEY` is a Worker secret (`wrangler secret put NUXT_SFL_API_KEY`). The old `OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` are no longer used by anything.

### Deployment

Deployed as a Cloudflare Worker (SSR via Nitro `cloudflare-module` preset) at `reader.phareim.no`. Config in `wrangler.toml` — bindings: `DB` (D1 `reader-service`), `ARTICLE_BUCKET` (R2 `reader-articles`). CI in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs `npm run build` then `wrangler deploy` on every push to `main` (needs `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` + `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` secrets). Apply schema changes with `wrangler d1 execute reader-service --file=database/d1-schema.sql` (migrations live in `database/migrations/`). **CI does not run migrations** — apply an incremental file to prod yourself with `--remote` (e.g. `wrangler d1 execute reader-service --remote --file=database/migrations/005-highlights.sql`) before/with the deploy. Latest applied: `008-read-progress.sql` (adds `Article.read_progress` for the keep-my-place reading position; applied to remote 2026-07-02).

One Workers **secret** must exist for the elevate feature: `npx wrangler secret put NUXT_SFL_API_KEY` (the SFL API key; `NUXT_SFL_API_URL` ships in `wrangler.toml` `[vars]`). Without it, elevate returns 503 and everything else works.

**PWA / service worker** (`@vite-pwa/nuxt` in `nuxt.config.ts`): `registerType: 'prompt'` — a new SW waits until the user taps Reload in `PwaUpdatePrompt.vue` (which is built for prompt mode), so a deploy never yanks the running build's chunks out of the precache mid-session. The precached app shell `'/'` is stamped with a **per-build revision** (`buildRevision` at the top of `nuxt.config.ts`); never set it back to `revision: null` — Workbox then pins the first-ever cached shell forever while each deploy purges the hashed `_nuxt/*` chunks it references, and the app boots a shell pointing at 404'd JS and goes dead (bit us 2026-07-02, felt like "the app is unresponsive"). Workbox tests `runtimeCaching` regexes against the **full URL**, so path-anchored `/^\/api\/…/` patterns silently never match — the API routes use `({ url }) => url.pathname.startsWith(…)` functions instead (NetworkFirst, 5s network timeout, for offline reads). Recovery for a device stuck on a dead shell: open the app once so the fixed SW installs in the background, force-quit, reopen (worst case: Safari → Settings → clear website data for the domain and re-add the PWA).

### Common Development Patterns

**Adding a new composable**: Create in `composables/` directory. Will be auto-imported. Use `useState` for global reactive state.

**Adding a new API route**: Create in `server/api/` following the existing pattern. Use `defineEventHandler`, `getAuthenticatedUser`, and return typed responses.

**Adding a new component**: Create in `components/` or subdirectory. Will be auto-imported (`components/tufte/` without prefix). Use `<script setup>` with TypeScript. Compose the Tufte primitives rather than re-inventing labels/buttons/rules.

**Modifying database schema**:
1. Update `database/d1-schema.sql`
2. Apply via `wrangler d1 execute reader-service --file=database/d1-schema.sql` (add a numbered file under `database/migrations/` for incremental changes)

### Component Communication

Components communicate via:
- **Props** - Parent to child data flow
- **Emits** - Child to parent events (e.g. CardStack's `@sync` / `@count`)
- **Composables** - Shared global state (preferred over prop drilling)
- **`defineExpose`** - The page drives CardStack imperatively (`commit` / `undo` / `openTop`) so keys and gestures share one path

### Testing Feed Discovery

The app can discover feeds from:
- Direct RSS/Atom feed URLs
- Website URLs (looks for `<link>` tags pointing to feeds)
- Returns multiple feeds if found (e.g., multiple RSS versions)

## MCP Server Integration

The project includes a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that allows Claude Desktop to interact with your RSS reader. This enables conversational access to your feeds, articles, and saved content.

### Architecture

```
Claude Desktop
    ↓ (stdio via MCP protocol)
MCP Server (mcp-server/index.ts)
    ↓ (HTTP + X-MCP-Token header)
Nuxt API (http://localhost:3000/api/*)
    ↓
Database (Cloudflare D1 + R2)
```

The MCP server:
- Runs as a separate Node.js process launched by Claude Desktop
- Communicates via stdin/stdout using the MCP protocol
- Makes authenticated HTTP requests to your Reader API
- Shares TypeScript types with the main app (types/api.ts)

### Available MCP Tools (10 total)

**Read Tools:**
- `list_feeds` - Get all RSS feeds with unread counts and tags
- `get_recent_articles` - Fetch articles with filters (feed, read status, limit)
- `search_articles` - Search articles by criteria
- `get_article` - Get full article content by ID
- `get_saved_articles` - List saved articles (with optional tag filter)
- `list_tags` - Get all tags with usage counts

**Write Tools:**
- `save_article` - Save an article for later reading
- `unsave_article` - Remove article from saved
- `tag_article` - Add/update tags on saved articles
- `add_article` - Add manual article (not from RSS) with title, URL, and tags

### Authentication

The MCP server uses per-user token-based authentication stored in the database:

**Server-side** (`server/utils/auth.ts`):
- `getAuthenticatedUser()` checks for `X-MCP-Token` header first
- Looks up user by token in the database (User.mcpToken field)
- Falls back to session authentication for browser requests
- Both methods return the same authenticated user

**User Setup** (Multi-user support):
1. Navigate to `/mcp-settings` in your Reader web app (must be logged in)
2. Click "Generate Token" to create your personal MCP token
3. Enter the path to your cloned Reader repository
4. Copy the generated Claude Desktop configuration
5. Paste into your `claude_desktop_config.json`
6. Restart Claude Desktop

**Database schema**:
- `User.mcpToken` - Unique token per user (nullable, 64-char hex)
- `User.mcpTokenCreatedAt` - Token creation timestamp

**Claude Desktop config** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "the-librarian": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/your/reader/node_modules/.bin/tsx",
        "/path/to/your/reader/mcp-server/index.ts"
      ],
      "env": {
        "READER_API_URL": "https://reader.phareim.no",
        "MCP_TOKEN": "your-personal-token-from-settings-page"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Security:**
- Each user has their own unique token
- Tokens can be regenerated or revoked at any time via `/mcp-settings`
- No shared credentials or environment variables needed
- Token identifies the user, eliminating need for MCP_USER_EMAIL

### Running the MCP Server

**Development:**
```bash
npm run mcp  # Runs tsx mcp-server/index.ts
```

**With Claude Desktop:**
1. Configure `claude_desktop_config.json` with correct paths
2. Restart Claude Desktop completely
3. MCP tools appear automatically in Claude

### Usage Examples

Once connected, you can ask Claude:

```
"What are my recent unread articles?"
"Show me articles from TechCrunch"
"Save the article about renewable energy"
"What tags do I have?"
"Add this article to my Reader: [title] [url] and tag it with 'AI'"
"Show me all saved articles tagged with 'machine-learning'"
```

### Special Features

**Manual Article Addition:**
- Articles added via `add_article` are stored in a special "Manual Additions" feed
- This feed is auto-created on first manual article
- Allows Claude to curate content for you from conversations

**Tag Integration:**
- Claude can see all your existing tags via `list_tags`
- Can apply existing tags when adding articles
- Maintains consistency with your organization system
